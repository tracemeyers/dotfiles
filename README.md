## Bootstrap

First, download the bootstrap script

	curl --location https://github.com/tracemeyers/dotfiles/raw/main/bootstrap-dotfiles.sh \
	     --output ~/Downloads/bootstrap-dotfiles.sh

Then look at the file to make sure it looks reasonable.

	# Review it just to make sure it looks right
	cat ~/Downloads/bootstrap-dotfiles.sh

If it looks OK, then make it executable.

	# If it looks reasonble, then make it executable
	chmod u+x ~/Downloads/bootstrap-dotfiles.sh

Finally, start the bootstrap process
	
	~/Downloads/bootstrap-dotfiles.sh
